Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set.\n\n#### 3.1 Merges final data set with activityLabels to add activity description  \n\n#### 3.2 We have added a new variable to final, so I reassign column names to consider this\n\n### 4. Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names. \n\n#### 4.1 Let's replace variable names by more significant ones \n\n  - I remove parenthesis and dashes\n  - I change mean into Mean\n  - I change std into Std\n  - I change variables beginning with t into time\n  - I change variables beginning with f into freq\n  - etc.\n\n#### 4.2 We must update colNames vector again\n\n  - I reassign column names to consider these last changes\n  \n#### 4.3 Export the final data set \n\n  - The output file called tidyData1.txt will be located at UCI HAR Dataset subfolder\n  - tidyData1.txt is a tab-delimited text file\n\n### 5. Creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.\n\n#### 5.1 Create a new table, finalNoActivityType without the activityType column\n\n  - In order to compute the mean I remove previously the column activityType\n  \n#### 5.2 Summarizing the finalDataNoActivityType table to include just the mean of each variable for each activity and each subject\n\n#### 5.3 Merging the tidyData with activityTLabels to include descriptive acitvity names\n\n  - I merge again the activity description\n\n#### 5.4 Export the tidyData set\n\n  - The output file called tidyData2.txt will be located at UCI HAR Dataset subfolder\n  - tidyData2.txt is a tab-delimited text file",

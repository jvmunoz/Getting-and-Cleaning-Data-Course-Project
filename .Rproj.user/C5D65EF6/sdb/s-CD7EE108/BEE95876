Each person performed six activities (WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, LAYING) wearing a smartphone (Samsung Galaxy S II) on the waist. Using its embedded accelerometer and gyroscope, we captured 3-axial linear acceleration and 3-axial angular velocity at a constant rate of 50Hz. The experiments have been video-recorded to label the data manually. The obtained dataset has been randomly partitioned into two sets, where 70% of the volunteers was selected for generating the training data and 30% the test data.\n\nThe sensor signals (accelerometer and gyroscope) were pre-processed by applying noise filters and then sampled in fixed-width sliding windows of 2.56 sec and 50% overlap (128 readings/window). The sensor acceleration signal, which has gravitational and body motion components, was separated using a Butterworth low-pass filter into body acceleration and gravity. The gravitational force is assumed to have only low frequency components, therefore a filter with 0.3 Hz cutoff frequency was used. From each window, a vector of features was obtained by calculating variables from the time and frequency domain.\n\n## The data\n\nThe original data lives under  ./UCI HAR Dataset\n\nIt is split between two groups called \"test\" and \"train\"\n\nThe assumed file structure of the data set is as follows:\n```\n/Working Directory\n└──UCI HAR Dataset\n   ├── README.txt\n   ├── activity_labels.txt\n   ├── features.txt\n   ├── features_info.txt\n   ├── test\n   │   ├── Inertial Signals (**NOT NEEDED**)\n   │   ├── X_test.txt\n   │   ├── subject_test.txt\n   │   └── y_test.txt\n   └── train\n       ├── Inertial Signals(**NOT NEEDED**)\n       ├── X_train.txt\n       ├── subject_train.txt\n       └── y_train.txt\n```\n\nThe dataset includes the following files:\n\n- 'README.txt'\n- 'features_info.txt': Shows information about the variables used on the feature vector.\n- 'features.txt': List of all features.\n- 'activity_labels.txt': Links the class labels with their activity name.\n- 'train/X_train.txt': Training set.\n- 'train/y_train.txt': Training labels.\n- 'test/X_test.txt': Test set.\n- 'test/y_test.txt': Test labels.\n\nThe following files are available for the train and test data. Their descriptions are equivalent.\n\n- 'train/subject_train.txt': Each row identifies the subject who performed the activity for each window sample. Its range is from 1 to 30.\n- 'train/Inertial Signals/total_acc_x_train.txt': The acceleration signal from the smartphone accelerometer X axis in standard gravity units 'g'. Every row shows a 128 element vector. The same description applies for the 'total_acc_x_train.txt' and 'total_acc_z_train.txt' files for the Y and Z axis.\n- 'train/Inertial Signals/body_acc_x_train.txt': The body acceleration signal obtained by subtracting the gravity from the total acceleration.\n- 'train/Inertial Signals/body_gyro_x_train.txt': The angular velocity vector measured by the gyroscope for each window sample. The units are radians/second.\n\n## Transformation requirements\n\n1. Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.\n2. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.\n3. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set\n4. Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive activity names.\n5. Creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.\n\nrun_analysis.R cleans this data\n\n# Outputs\n\n## CodeBook for the cleaned data (tidyData1.txt and tidyData2.txt)\n\n### tidyData1.txt\n\ntidyData1.txt is a tab-delimited text file\n\ncontains the mean and standard deviation of each measurement for all subjects and tests\n\ncontains 10299 rows and 69 columns\n\n### tidyData2.txt\n\ntidyData2.txt is a tab-delimited text file\n\ncontains the mean measurement for each subject and test\n\ncontains 180 rows and 69 columns\n\n#### common columns for both\n\n* \"activityId\"\n* \"subjectId\"\n* \"timeBodyAccMeanX\"             \n* \"timeBodyAccMeanY\"\n* \"timeBodyAccMeanZ\"\n* \"timeBodyAccStdX\"              \n* \"timeBodyAccStdY\"\n* \"timeBodyAccStdZ\"\n* \"timeGravityAccMeanX\"          \n* \"timeGravityAccMeanY\"\n* \"timeGravityAccMeanZ\"\n* \"timeGravityAccStdX\"           \n* \"timeGravityAccStdY\"\n* \"timeGravityAccStdZ\"\n* \"timeBodyAccJerkMeanX\"         \n* \"timeBodyAccJerkMeanY\"\n* \"timeBodyAccJerkMeanZ\"\n* \"timeBodyAccJerkStdX\"          \n* \"timeBodyAccJerkStdY\"\n* \"timeBodyAccJerkStdZ\"\n* \"timeBodyGyroMeanX\"            \n* \"timeBodyGyroMeanY\"\n* \"timeBodyGyroMeanZ\"\n* \"timeBodyGyroStdX\"             \n* \"timeBodyGyroStdY\"\n* \"timeBodyGyroStdZ\"\n* \"timeBodyGyroJerkMeanX\"        \n* \"timeBodyGyroJerkMeanY\"\n* \"timeBodyGyroJerkMeanZ\"\n* \"timeBodyGyroJerkStdX\"         \n* \"timeBodyGyroJerkStdY\"\n* \"timeBodyGyroJerkStdZ\"\n* \"timeBodyAccMagnitudeMean\"     \n* \"timeBodyAccMagnitudeStd\"\n* \"timeGravityAccMagnitudeMean\"\n* \"timeGravityAccMagnitudeStd\"   \n* \"timeBodyAccJerkMagnitudeMean\"\n* \"timeBodyAccJerkMagnitudeStd\"\n* \"timeBodyGyroMagnitudeMean\"    \n* \"timeBodyGyroMagnitudeStd\"\n* \"timeBodyGyroJerkMagnitudeMean\"\n* \"timeBodyGyroJerkMagnitudeStd\" \n* \"freqBodyAccMeanX\"\n* \"freqBodyAccMeanY\"\n* \"freqBodyAccMeanZ\"             \n* \"freqBodyAccStdX\"\n* \"freqBodyAccStdY\"\n* \"freqBodyAccStdZ\"              \n* \"freqBodyAccJerkMeanX\"\n* \"freqBodyAccJerkMeanY\"\n* \"freqBodyAccJerkMeanZ\"         \n* \"freqBodyAccJerkStdX\"\n* \"freqBodyAccJerkStdY\"\n* \"freqBodyAccJerkStdZ\"          \n* \"freqBodyGyroMeanX\"\n* \"freqBodyGyroMeanY\"\n* \"freqBodyGyroMeanZ\"            \n* \"freqBodyGyroStdX\"\n* \"freqBodyGyroStdY\"\n* \"freqBodyGyroStdZ\"             \n* \"freqBodyAccMagnitudeMean\"\n* \"freqBodyAccMagnitudeStd\"\n* \"freqBodyAccJerkMagnitudeMean\" \n* \"freqBodyAccJerkMagnitudeStd\"\n* \"freqBodyGyroMagnitudeMean\"\n* \"freqBodyGyroMagnitudeStd\"     \n* \"freqBodyGyroJerkMagnitudeMean\"\n* \"freqBodyGyroJerkMagnitudeStd\"\n* \"activityType\" \n",
